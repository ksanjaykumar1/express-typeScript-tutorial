Data access objects (DAOs)
Data transfer objects (DTOs)
That one-letter difference between acronyms is essential: A DAO is responsible for connecting to a defined database and performing CRUD operations; a DTO is an object that holds the raw data that the DAO will send to—and receive from—the database.

In other words, DTOs are objects that conform to data model types, and DAOs are the services that use them.
